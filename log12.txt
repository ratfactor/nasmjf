    Okay, EMIT is written. Now to test it, I'll
    push an ASCII character value on the stack
    and call it.

(gdb) c
Continuing.
65 EMIT
A

    No way...it works!

    How about pushing "Foo" onto the stack and
    emitting it all at once:

70 111 111 EMIT EMIT EMIT
ooF

    Ha ha, "oof" is right. The first of, no doubt,
    many out-of-order mistakes.

111 111 70 EMIT EMIT EMIT
Foo

    Now how about compiling a word?

: star 42 EMIT ;
star
*

    And the true test: can I compile a word using the
    new word?

: 3star star star star ;
3star
***

    Wow. I have a FORTH!

    JonesFORTH defines a bunch of words in assembly (mostly
    for speed - there's some theoretical minimum core of
    FORTH words from which all the others could be defined,
    but assembly's gonna be faster.

    So what I'll do is start implementing those. I'll try
    to test them all with EMIT output because that's more fun
    than examining registers. But I doubt we're done with
    GBD just yet.
