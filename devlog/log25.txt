    Okay, I guess I lied. I'm back sooner than I thought.

    In addition to cleaning up, I've made a much-needed
    improvement. I now load _all_ of jonesforth.f upon
    start, so there's no need for the line limit. So I'm
    properly checking for EOF while reading that file and
    closing it.

    It takes a lot of lines of assembly to produce a nice
    error message. See the label ".loadjf_open_fail" in
    nasmjf.asm for the listing. (It's not complicated, just
    long.)

    Here's how it looks:

$ nasmjf/nasmjf
ERROR Could not open 'jonesforth/jonesforth.f'.

    But it still runs fine from the nasmjf/ dir:

$ cd nasmjf
$ ./nasmjf
JONESFORTH VERSION 48
20643 CELLS REMAINING
OK

    And I really love being able to run the test suite to
    make sure I haven't messed anything up!

$ ./test.sh
Testing: jonesforth/test_assembler.f
Testing: jonesforth/test_comparison.f
Testing: jonesforth/test_exception.f
Testing: jonesforth/test_number.f
Testing: jonesforth/test_read_file.f
Testing: jonesforth/test_stack.f
Testing: jonesforth/test_stack_trace.f

    In theory, my Forth source reading mechanism could be
    used _within_ Forth to load source files on the fly. I
    think I'll leave that as an "exercise for the reader" as
    they say. :-)
