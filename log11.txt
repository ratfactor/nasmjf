    I find it hard to believe that I've discovered a
    bug in JonesFORTH, but it seems to me that my fix
    of simply removing FETCH from colon so that the
    word header that receives the HIDDEN flag is the
    one being compiled, not the previous one in the
    linked list (dictionary).

    So unless I discover otherwise, I've changed it
    from

        
        dd LATEST, FETCH, HIDDEN ; Make the word hidden while it's being compiled.

    to

        dd LATEST, HIDDEN ; Make the word hidden while it's being compiled.

(gdb) break code_LATEST
Breakpoint 2 at 0x804939d: file nasmjf.asm, line 772.
(gdb) c

Breakpoint 2, code_LATEST () at nasmjf.asm:772
772             push dword [var_%4]
27          lodsd     ; NEXT: Load from memory into eax, inc esi to point to next word.
28          jmp [eax] ; Jump to whatever code we're now pointing at.
code_HIDDEN () at nasmjf.asm:636
636         pop edi                 ; Dictionary entry, first byte is link
637         add edi, 4              ; Move to name/flags byte.

    If my fix works, then the word "FIVE" that is being compiled
    will be the one we're hiding until compilation is complete:

(gdb) x/bx $edi
0x804e004:      0x04
(gdb) x/bt $edi
0x804e004:      00000100
(gdb) x/4c $edi+1
0x804e005:      70 'F'  73 'I'  86 'V'  69 'E'

    Yup, looks good! And the hidden flag?

638         xor [edi], word F_HIDDEN  ; Toggle the HIDDEN bit in place.

(gdb) x/bt $edi
0x804e004:      00100100

    Next, let's implement BRANCH!
