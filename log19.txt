    The mind-destroying temporal manipulation operators
    continue now with a new word called

        [COMPILE] 

    Which compiles the next "word" of input even if it
    would otherwise have been immediate.

    This allows you to be your own father's uncle or
    something like that.

    And, of course, [COMPILE] itself is IMMEDIATE. Let's
    take a look at the whole definition with some Jones
    comments:
        
        : [COMPILE] IMMEDIATE
                WORD		\ get the next word
                FIND		\ find it in the dictionary
                >CFA		\ get its codeword
                ,		\ and compile that
        ;

    I have to keep reminding myself that even though
    [COMPILE] is IMMEDIATE, the WORD word's next word isn't
    FIND, it's whatever follows the *use* of [COMPILE], which
    is probably during compilation. I think we have exceeded
    the limitations of the English language now. Throw away
    your dictionaries, clocks, and family trees. Where we're
    going, we won't be needing those anymore. Set phasers for
    "make love to your own grandma" and prepare to jump to
    lightspeed toward Planet FORTH.

    I'm tired.

    Next night: Okay, I figured out how to test [COMPILE].
    I'll make a new IMMEDIATE word called foo that emits
    'z' when it runs.

: foo IMMEDIATE [ CHAR z ] LITERAL EMIT ;
foo
z

: bar 'A' EMIT foo 'A' EMIT ;
z

bar
AA

    Yup, foo runs when bar is compiled, not when bar runs.

    Then I'll see if I can use [COMPILE] to call foo at
    "runtime" instead:

: bar2 'A' EMIT [COMPILE] foo 'A' EMIT ;
bar2
AzA

    Yes! Nailed it.


    Next, RECURSE...



        \ RECURSE makes a recursive call to the current word that is being compiled.
        \
        \ Normally while a word is being compiled, it is marked HIDDEN so that references to the
        \ same word within are calls to the previous definition of the word.  However we still have
        \ access to the word which we are currently compiling through the LATEST pointer so we
        \ can use that to compile a recursive call.
        : RECURSE IMMEDIATE
                LATEST @	\ LATEST points to the word being compiled at the moment
                >CFA		\ get the codeword
                ,		\ compile it
        ;
