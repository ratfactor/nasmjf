    So log19.txt had a major breakthrough with my
    understanding of Forth variables. And it solved a
    previous mystery of the need for FETCH after the
    variable LATEST.

    Unfortunately, I'm still crashing with a segfault and
    getting PARSE ERROR on some jonesforth.f source.

    So I'll set my lines to read to just before that error
    and continue reading and testing the Forth source:

        %assign __lines_of_jf_to_read 704

    After RECURSE comes IF ... THEN statements! Oooh,
    exiciting stuff. With this, I can *finally* write
    programs with branching and logic!
