    Two new words add to the word "compiler" abilities of
    the interpreter:

        IMMEDIATE  sets the latest word to be "immediate"
        HIDE       takes the next "word" of input, looks it up
                   in the dictionary, and then sets that word
                   to be hidden (via the word HIDDEN)

    HIDE seems the easiest to test, so we'll start with that:

: emit2 EMIT EMIT ;
66 65 emit2
AB
HIDE emit2
66 65 emit2
PARSE ERROR: 66 65 emit2

    That worked: we get the parse error because emit2 has been
    hidden and is no longer found in the dictionary.

    The HIDDEN word used by HIDE actually toggles the hidden state,
    so can we call HIDE again to unhide the word?

HIDE emit2

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
code_HIDDEN () at nasmjf.asm:635
635         xor [edi], word F_HIDDEN  ; Toggle the HIDDEN bit in place.

    Oh, ha ha, no, of course not. It's hidden, so HIDE can't
    find it (and since there's absolutely no error checking,
    we crash trying to toggle the bit in some random memory
    location).

    I guess we could use LATEST and HIDDEN to manually toggle
    it back, but I can't be bothered tonight.

    Onward to IMMEDIATE.

: ab 66 65 EMIT EMIT ;
IMMEDIATE
: foo 1000 . ;
foo
foo
55 EMIT
;

^C
Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.
_WORD.skip_non_words () at nasmjf.asm:339
339         call _KEY               ; get next key, returned in %eax

   Something went wrong. I had to Ctrl+C to end the
   program. It was merrily taking input, but nothing
   would execute, not even Ctrl+D to end the input
   and exit.

   Let's try that again and verify we're toggling the
   right word...

(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/dave/nasmjf/nasmjf
(gdb) c
Continuing.
LATEST 4 + C@ .
6
LATEST 5 + C@ EMIT
L

    Okay, just sanity checking LATEST - it points to
    a word with 6 letters in the name and starts with
    the letter "L" (it's LATEST itself).

    I'll define my 'ab' word again, try it out (it should
    print the letters "AB"), and check LATEST again...

: ab 66 65 EMIT EMIT ;
ab
AB
LATEST 4 + C@ .
2
LATEST 5 + C@ EMIT
a
IMMEDIATE
ab

    Drat! Then it locked up again. So IMMEDIATE is
    definitely not working right.
