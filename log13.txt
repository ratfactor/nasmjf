    Now we can start fleshing out this Forth implementation
    with some basic words. I'll start with the stack manipulation
    words as defined in assembly (for speed) in JonesFORTH:

        ; drop top of stack
        DEFCODE "DROP",4,,DROP
        pop eax
        NEXT

    I'll test each one out as I go. Here's DROP:

65 EMIT
A
65 66 67
DROP EMIT
B
EMIT
A

    Good, it dropped 67 ('c') from the top of the stack.

    And swap:

        ; swap top two elements
        DEFCODE "SWAP",4,,SWAP
        pop eax
        pop ebx
        push eax
        push ebx
        NEXT

    Which is easy to test:

65 66 EMIT EMIT
BA
65 66 SWAP EMIT EMIT
AB

    Finally,

        ; duplicate element on top of stack
        DEFCODE "DUP",3,,DUP
        mov eax, [esp]
        push eax
        NEXT

65 DUP 66 DUP EMIT EMIT EMIT EMIT
BBAA

    Awesome.
